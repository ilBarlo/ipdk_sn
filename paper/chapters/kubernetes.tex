\subsection{Support}
Is there a repository that aims to develop a recipe to use IPDK in a kubernetes environment.
This recipe has some constraints that make difficult its usability in a real-world use case.
The recipe is on GitHub, at the link https://github.com/ipdk-io/k8s-infra-offload.
At the moment this recipe is working only with Open vSwitch but in the future will be possible to use it also with hardware target.

There is a big problem related to hardware targets: a large amount of local packets will be processed by the SmartNic once the recipe is offloaded to it. This incredibly high number of packets may be a problem from a performance point of view.
