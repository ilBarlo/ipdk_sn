SmartNICs, i.e., network interface cards that include additional highly programmable logic for dataplane acceleration, could become very important in the coming years, and we are assisting into a marked consolidation with many small players (i.e., startups) being acquired by big companies (e.g., Barefoot from Intel; Pensando from AMD; Mellanox from nVidia). This project aims at exploring what is the Intel Infrastructure Processing Strategy (https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/network-io/infrastructure-processing-units/asic/es2000asic.html), which was previously known as Mount Evans (https://www.servethehome.com/new-intel-mount-evans-ipu-asic-dpu-at-intel-vision-2022/), what it does, and which implications has into both datacenter and edge contexts.
